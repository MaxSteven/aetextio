aetextio
========

Used to import/export comma separated text files via After Effects. Good for mass replacing text layer values.

Run scripts using File > Scripts > aetextout.jsx     or     aetextin.jsx

aetextout.jsx

This script will export all of your text layer values to a csv(comma separated value text file), in order. From here you can replace values with what ever you would like.... when you are done, run the aetextin.jsx script.

aetextin.jsx
========
This script will import your updated csv text file and replace the text layers with the corresponing data.
You can undo via `ctr+z` Windows or `cmd+z` Mac.
